    "description": "This is an example project for the Mike Wallace Interview. Mike Wallace rose to prominence in 1956 with the New York City television interview program Night-Beat, which soon developed into the nationally televised prime-time program The Mike Wallace Interview. Along with this project are some potential interdisciplinary questions for instructors interested in working with AV (via AVAnnotate) and HRC collections.",
